## Final project for Haaga Helia University of Applied Sciences [Server Programming course](https://opinto-opas.haaga-helia.fi/course_unit/SWD4TF021).

The goal was to make an application displaying some information relating to for example to movies, music, sports etc.
Only signed-in users can alter data, but anyone can view it. Database for the app needed to contain at least two tables.

- Spring Boot Web (MVC)
- Thymeleaf templates (HTML 5)
- JPA or JDBCTemplate  (H2 or MariaDB)
- Spring Boot Security
- Bean Validation (html form, @Valid )
- Spring Boot REST (JSON)

and at least two of the following:

- AJAX JS/JQuery/React tms.
- Testing (JUnit,..)
- CSS
- I18n (multiple languages) 
- some other Spring Boot-functionality

~~The app is running in Heroku: [Recipelist](https://recipe-storage.herokuapp.com/recipelist)~~
